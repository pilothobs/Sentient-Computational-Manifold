# Sentient Computational Manifold (SCM)

**A framework for building intelligent, adaptive, and self-evolving software systems.**

SCM represents a shift from traditional, brittle codebases to dynamic, machine-readable computation graphs. Logic, behavior, execution constraints, and adaptation strategies are encoded within self-describing JSON nodes, enabling systems that can validate, simulate, execute, observe, and even rewrite themselves.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Declarative Nodes:** Define computational units in JSON using a rigorous schema (`scm/schemas/scm_node.schema.json`), specifying metadata, dependencies, I/O contracts, execution logic, resilience policies, and adaptation strategies.
*   **Graph Composition:** Automatically build and validate executable Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) from node dependencies (`scm/graph/`).
*   **Typed Execution:** Supports multiple execution types per node (`Model_Ref`, `External_Call`, `Subgraph_Ref`, etc.), currently simulated but designed for real implementation (`scm/runtime/`).
*   **Dynamic Model Loading:** Nodes of type `Model_Ref` dynamically load and execute corresponding Python modules from `scm/models/`, adhering to a defined interface.
*   **Agent-Driven Orchestration:** An intelligent agent monitors graph execution, evaluates risks, enforces policies, and can intervene based on runtime conditions (`scm/agents/`).
*   **Comprehensive Observability:** Detailed execution tracing (`scm_traces/`) captures events, inputs, outputs, metrics, and agent decisions for analysis (`scm/monitoring/`). Dedicated viewers (`scm/tools/`) provide human-readable reports.
*   **Adaptive Learning Loop:** Nodes can define adaptation strategies. Based on execution metrics (e.g., low confidence), the system can automatically trigger adaptations (currently simulated parameter adjustments) and perform **auto-versioning**, creating new node JSON files (`scm/adaptive/`).
*   **Unified CLI:** Interact with all core functionalities (validate, compose, simulate, agent-run, evaluate, view logs) via a central command-line tool (`scm/cli/`, `scm/tools/scm.py`).
*   **Graph Visualization:** Generate visual representations of the node graph, including dependencies and adaptation history (`scm/tools/visualize_graph.py`).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

SCM consists of several core modules:

1.  **Schema & Nodes (`schemas/`, `nodes/`)**: Defines the structure (`scm_node.schema.json`) and holds instances of SCM nodes (JSON files).
2.  **Graph (`graph/`)**: The `SCMGraphComposer` builds the executable DAG from nodes and determines the execution plan.
3.  **Runtime (`runtime/`)**: The `SCMExecutionEngine` executes individual nodes based on their `execution_logic`, handling dynamic loading for `Model_Ref` types and simulation for others. Includes simulation utilities.
4.  **Models (`models/`)**: Contains Python modules implementing the actual logic for `Model_Ref` nodes, adhering to the `run_model(inputs, params)` interface.
5.  **Agents (`agents/`)**: The `SCMAgentOrchestrator` oversees graph execution, performs checks, and calls the adaptation manager.
6.  **Monitoring (`monitoring/`)**: The `SCMTracer` manages trace sessions and logs detailed execution events.
7.  **Adaptive (`adaptive/`)**: The `AdaptationManager` evaluates adaptation triggers based on metrics and performs auto-versioning.
8.  **CLI & Tools (`cli/`, `tools/`)**: Provides user interfaces (main CLI, log viewers, visualizer).

## üìä Graph Visualization

*(This shows the current state of the example graph, including the adapted forecast node)*

```dot
// Example DOT representation snippet (Generated by visualize_graph.py)
digraph SCM_Graph {
	rankdir=TB
	splines=ortho
	nodesep=0.8
	ranksep=1.0
	node [shape=record style=filled fillcolor="#EFEFEF" fontname=Helvetica fontsize=10]
	edge [fontname=Helvetica fontsize=9]
	// ... nodes ...
	subgraph cluster_node_forecast_sales { ... }
	// ... edges ...
}
```

*(You can generate the actual graph image using `scm/tools/visualize_graph.py` - see Quick Start / Usage)*

*(The image above should render once the Graphviz tools are installed and visualize_graph.py is run)*

## ü§ñ LLM-Ready by Design

SCM's declarative, machine-readable nature makes it ideal for interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). Potential use cases include:

*   **Graph Comprehension:** LLMs can parse node definitions and graph structures to explain complex workflows.
*   **Node Generation:** Generate new SCM nodes based on high-level goals or natural language descriptions.
*   **Simulation & Analysis:** Use LLMs to simulate different scenarios or analyze trace logs for insights.
*   **Adaptation Suggestions:** Propose new adaptation strategies or parameter adjustments based on performance trends.

## üîÑ The Adaptation Loop Explained

SCM's ability to adapt is a key feature. Here's how the current loop works:

1.  **Node Definition:** An SCM node (e.g., `node_forecast_sales_v2.1.0`) defines an `adaptation_strategy`, specifying a `trigger` (e.g., `Performance_Degradation`), a relevant `metric_ref`, and an adaptation `method` (e.g., `Adjust_Parameters`).
2.  **Execution & Monitoring:** During execution (via `agent-run`), the `SCMExecutionEngine` runs the node and records metrics (like `simulated_confidence`) in the metadata.
3.  **Agent Orchestrator:** After successful node execution, the `SCMAgentOrchestrator` calls the `AdaptationManager`.
4.  **Trigger Evaluation:** The `AdaptationManager` (`adaptive/adaptation_manager.py`) checks if the trigger condition is met using the recorded execution metadata (e.g., is `simulated_confidence < PERFORMANCE_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`?).
5.  **Adaptation Action (Simulated):** If triggered, the manager simulates the specified `method`. For `Adjust_Parameters`, it currently makes a *random* adjustment to one of the parameters defined in the node's `execution_logic`.
6.  **Auto-Versioning:** A new JSON file for the node is created (e.g., `node_forecast_sales_v2.2.0.json`). The `version` and `@id` fields are incremented (minor version bump), and metadata like `rationale`, `creation_timestamp`, `author_agent_ref`, and `derived_from` are updated.
7.  **Logging:** The adaptation event (trigger, method, versions, etc.) is recorded in the `adaptation_log.jsonl` file (viewable with `tools/view_adaptations.py`).

*Note: The next time the graph composer runs, it will typically pick up the latest valid version of each node (e.g., `v2.2.0`) for the execution plan.*

## üó∫Ô∏è Future Roadmap

This implementation provides a foundational proof-of-concept. Potential next steps include:

*   **Real Execution Logic:** Implement non-simulated logic for `External_Call` (actual API calls) and `Algorithm_Ref` (running defined algorithms).
*   **Real Data Passing:** Move beyond mock inputs/outputs; serialize/deserialize actual data structures between nodes based on `data_type_ref`.
*   **Sophisticated Adaptation:** Implement specific parameter adjustment logic, model retraining triggers, and potentially structural graph evolution methods.
*   **State Management:** Implement persistent state (`Stateful`, `Contextual`) using configurable backends (e.g., Redis, databases).
*   **Agent Intelligence:** Enhance the `SCMAgentOrchestrator` with more complex reasoning, goal orientation, and learning capabilities.
*   **Error Handling & Resilience:** Implement more robust `resilience_policy` actions (e.g., actual Retry, Fallback execution paths).
*   **Input Parameterization:** Allow passing external parameters (`source: external_parameter`) when invoking graph runs via the CLI.
*   **Testing:** Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests.
*   **Schema Evolution:** Define schemas for data types (`type_...`) and metrics (`metric_def_...`).
